The requirement of the programming assessment
The following where the requirements when I was given the assessment:

- Use the Rijksmuseum API: https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/
- The app needs to have at least 2 screens. An overview screen that has a list of items using section headers, items that have text & image + the screen should be paginated
- Loading of data and images should be asynchronous. A loading indicator should be shown.
- Automated test should be present (full coverage not needed ofc)
- Use Fragments & use Kotlin
